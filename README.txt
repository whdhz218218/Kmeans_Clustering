    All the classes are under "assignment1" package. And main class is to conduct Kmeans and main2 class is to conduct Kmeans2. You can run the main and main2 class. For main, the coordinates of all the centroids will be firstly printed out. Then the fitness method results are printed out. And then the optimal fitness value is printed out. At last, the graph of distribution of all the centroids will come out. For main2, the coordinates of all the centroids will be firstly printed out. Then the fitness method results are printed out. At last, the graph of distribution of all the centroids will come out. 

    For Fitness class, First, I draw the graph of distribution of centroids. For both graphs, we can see that Kmeans1 and Kmeans2 are relatively resonable since centriods are distributed with relatively equal adjacent distances.
    Second, I calculated the sum of the sum of distances of all the points and their corresponding centroids. I think that the more closer the value is to the optimal, the better the Kmeans Algorithm is. Actually, according to the assignment requirement, the best distance between two centroids are about 4.5. However, when I use 4.5, it's impossible to put 500 centroids whose distance between the other is 4.5. I don't know how to put exactly 500 centroids in it with certain adjacent distance. So I use 4.3 and 4.4, but I can put 484 or 529 centroids in the matrix. And I get the range of the optimal sum of distances that is [16657.99 , 18058.09], then I get the distance for Kmeans1, which is 17453.74. It falls in this range so I think it's resonable algorithm with good fit. For Kmeans2, it is 21934.06, it is far out of the range, so I think that Kmeans2 is not a so good algorithm.
    Thid, I calculated the average adjacent distance between one centroid and others within the circle with radius sqrt(2)*4.5, which is the diagonal of a square of 4.5*4.5. And it is the longest distance of two adjacent centroids can be. The closer this average value is to 4.5, the better the algorithm is. For Kmeans1, the value is 4.132. For Kmeans2, the value is 4.063. So the value of Kmeans1 is closer to the optimal value.
